Identifying high streets in Yorkshire using DBSCAN clustering

## Background

Ordnance Survey built Britain's first nationwide high street map. Whilst the map can be viewed by the public, the underlying data is restricted to OS and local government.

This project aims to recreate the processes used by OS to produce a high street map for Yorkshire.
